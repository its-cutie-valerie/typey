# Typey
A small learning project written in React for [Cod√©dex](https://www.codedex.io/home) final project from their React curriculum. My initial idea came from how slowly I was typing during working on another project, which got eventually deleted and replaced with Typey. It uses a random word API to get the words, and then some magic and fine tuning to make it function as it does.

To run this locally, simply git clone the repository, enter the root folder, open terminal and type `npm run dev`

### To-do list: 
- Add settings and more options
- Polish the code
- Add themes and make it look more appealing to the eye
- Add leaderboards, more social interactions, duels and minigames
- Polish the learning tab (it is there to demonstrate responsiveness as of right now)
